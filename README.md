# Microsoft Fabric Playground: PySpark, Spark SQL & Datasets

Welcome to the **Microsoft Fabric Playground** repository! This project is designed to offer a hands-on introduction to PySpark and Spark SQL within the Microsoft Fabric environment. Whether you're a beginner in big data processing or an experienced developer looking to enhance your skills, this repository provides practical experience using real datasets and PySpark scripts.

## Contents

### PySpark & Spark SQL Script
The repository includes a well-structured PySpark and Spark SQL script, demonstrating essential data processing tasks. This script walks you through key operations such as:
- Data loading
- Cleaning
- Transformation
- Aggregation

These foundational tasks serve as a stepping stone for more advanced analytics and big data operations.

### Dataset
A sample dataset is included to help you explore typical data challenges and scenarios. The dataset is pre-configured for use with the PySpark script, allowing you to dive straight into the process of exploration and manipulation.

## Objectives

### Master PySpark & Spark SQL
Gain a solid understanding of PySpark and Spark SQL, key components of the big data ecosystem. This repository will guide you through fundamental concepts and techniques for working with DataFrames and performing various operations.

### Hands-on Data Processing
Enhance your data engineering skills by practicing tasks such as filtering, grouping, and joining datasets. The script is modular and can easily be modified, allowing you to experiment with different methods and approaches to data processing.

### Build Your Own Projects
This repository serves as a robust foundation for your own data projects. You can extend the script to handle larger datasets, integrate with other tools in the Microsoft Fabric ecosystem, or adapt it to meet specific business requirements.
